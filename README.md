WebSearchBot is a discord bot that can generate website links and take a screenshot of them, then send it to Discord. It uses a service called APIFlash to take a screenshot of the desired webpage and also generates a link to the webpage. You will need a APIFlash key so you will need to register here: https://apiflash.com and you will also need a Discord bot token which you can get here: https://discord.com/developers.
