WebSearchBot is a discord bot that can generate website links and take a screenshot of them, then send it to Discord. It uses a service called APIFlash to take a screenshot of the desired webpage and also generates a link to the webpage. You will need a APIFlash key so you will need to register here: https://apiflash.com and you will also need a Discord bot token which you can get here: https://discord.com/developers. To install the requirements you just need to install Discord.py 0.16.12 in Python 3.6 so it will run properly. If there are any issues please ask on the Discord or on the respository.
